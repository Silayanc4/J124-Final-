## Story Pitch

Students who are Free and Reduced Price Meal Eligible are described in the data set as
“(1) applying for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP); (2) submitting alternative household income forms; (3) student homeless, migrant, or tribal foster youth statuses in CALPADS;  (4) being "directly certified" through CALPADS as participating in California's food stamp or CalWORKs programs or (5) being identified through the weekly CALPADS Foster Matching process or matched by the LEA through the CALPADS online match process as being in Foster Placement, Foster Family Maintenance, or Tribal Foster on Census day”.

I wanted to observe FRPM data within Juvenile Court Schools, but soon saw that 100% of the students within Juvenile Court Schools were FRPM eligible. I also wanted to specifically focus on where Juvenile Court Schools were concentrated. Comparing Juvenile Court Schools within their own county by FRPM levels also helped put their FRPM into a local context. Larger differences between the FRPM levels of Juvenile Court Schools and the rest of their county might be concerning and worth exploring on even smaller scales like cities. Higher counts of Juvenile Court Schools could also be worth exploring for negligence or high socioeconomic difference within the county- especially with larger differences in FRPM eligibility in a local context. 

## Additional Sourcing 
### ![School Accountability Report Card](https://www.sarconline.org/public/findASarc) 
Each school would show a lot more data on demographics, English learning percentages, and homelessness. 

### Department of Justice (2020). Criminal Justice Data. Juvenile Court and Probation.
The department of justice’s [website](https://data-openjustice.doj.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/Juvenile%20Justice%20In%20CA%202020.pdf) is not working, so data must be requested in order to get access to it. This would show sentencing data and if they are possibly getting transferred to an adult facility.

# Data Analysis 
### Here are my guiding questions 
1. How many juvenile court schools are there and where are they?
2. How populated are they? 
3. What is the free and reduced lunch average for these juvenile court schools? 
4. How do these juvenile court schools compare to other types of schools for eligible Free Lunches?
5. Which counties have the biggest difference between the percentage of free and reduced lunch eligible students of their juvenile court schools and the rest of the schools? 

## Download this [dataset](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filessp.asp) as a CSV file 
## Here is *[my dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WL1D8wbMM-r2la69j0H0akfdj5uftsPqEpW92ik-GIs/edit?usp=sharing)* that I used 

## How many juvenile court schools are there and where are they?
1. Isolate the juvenile court schools by filtering them

2. Copy and Paste them into a Pivot Table 
3. Make the rows their "County Names" and "County Codes" and the Value as "School Type" 
4. Name this "Location and Count"
